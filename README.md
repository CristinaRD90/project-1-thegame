# Desert hunt

_Hi everyone! Desert hunt is the game I developed as the first project in the Web Developer Bootcamp at Ironhack._

***

### How it was done? 

To develop this first version of _Desert hunt_ I have used [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/HTML/Canvas) which allowed me just with HTML5, CSS3 & JS to develop this cute game. 

Your caracter will be runnig throght the desert and you have to help her to get to the finish line. 
Some elements I added while developing this game where: 
* Deathly obstacles
* Harmful obstacles
* Regular obstacles
* Reward coins
* Music
* Sounds

### Where you can play?

If you feel like playing to _Desert hunt_ just click [here](https://cristinard90.github.io/project-1-thegame/) to start a new game. 

### How do you play?

It's actually quite easy. As I said before you main goal is to get to the fiish line, but, how can you do this? 
As the time passes your character will be moving forward on herself. 
You can always adnvance more with your **key right ->**, and you can move backwards, only untill the end of the canvas with the **key left <-** 

#### The cactus
Cactus are your deathly obstacles. As soon as you touch one... _Game over_ so be careful with them, you will have to use the **top key** to jump over them. 

#### The red flower
Be careful with this cute flower, it looks so lovely right? But if you touch it, it will take 10 from you coins. Too bad. 
But don't worry we have a solution. With the **space key** you can throw your amazing knifes with which you will destroy the poisonous flowers. 

#### Coins, coins, coins
Try to get as many coins as you can before you get to the finish line. Just walk over them and they will be added to your coin counter. 

#### Platform 
Just jump on top of the platform, it's quite fun. 

### Next steps
Our main goal is to add more levels with more obstacles.

**And before playing, remember to turn on the volume**
